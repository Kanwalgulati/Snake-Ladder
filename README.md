# Snake-Ladder
Welcome to the JavaScript implementation of Snakes and Ladders.
A remake of the classic Snakes and Ladders Board game.

Objectives.
  - Teaching the basics of Java Script , HTML and CSS
 
Codebase Used :-

HTML / CSS / Javascript

Concept :-

A directed graph is used to represent the game board.
The board has (by default) 100 cells (10 X 10).
Each cell in the board is linked to the next 6 cells (if they exist).
If a cell has a snake/ladder, it only has a single link to the cell where the snake/ladder leads.
Each player starts at 0.
Every move of a player is made by adding the number of steps to its current cell number.
The player, if lands on a snake/ladder cell, moves to the corresponding cell.
